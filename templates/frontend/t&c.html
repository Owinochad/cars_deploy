                You may make multiple free entries for any Competition up to any limit placed on entries by the Promoter (the maximum number of entries permitted per Entrant for a Competition will be listed on the webpage for the relevant Competition on the Website). However, each free entry must be submitted and posted to the Promoter separately. Bulk entries in one envelope or on one postcard will not be accepted as multiple entries and if a bulk entry is received, it will be counted as one single entry.

            <li>
                Your entry into a Standard Competition must be received by the Promoter prior to the Closing Date and prior to all tickets in a Competition being allocated. Free entries received within 48 hours of the Closing Date and/or the date on which all tickets have been sold/allocated will not be entered into the selected Competition but will, at the Promoter's discretion, be entered into the next Competition of a similar value for which entries remain available. Free entries which are otherwise received after the Closing Date and/or the date on which all tickets have been sold/allocated will not otherwise be entered into the selected Competition or any other Competition. Proof of posting does not guarantee that you will be entered into the random draw and will not be accepted as proof of receipt.

            <li>
                Your free entry into an Instant Win Competition must be received before all tickets have been sold/allocated or, if not all tickets are sold/allocated, within forty-eight hours (48 hours) after the Closing Date in order to be entered into the Instant Win Competition.

        <ol class="container mx-auto py-2">
            <li>For Standard Competitions, all Entrants who correctly answer the Competition Question will be placed into a draw, and an Entrant will be chosen by random draw to be eligible to receive the Prize. The random draw will take place as soon as reasonably possible and, in any event, within 7 days of the Closing Date (“Draw Date“).</li>
            <li>All Standard Competition Entrants will have their names and entry numbers included on a spreadsheet which may be published on the Website and may be visible during the live draw. If you do not wish to have your name included on this spreadsheet, you must contact the Promoter via email at <a href="mailto:info@mydreamcar.africa">info@mydreamcar.africa</a> as soon as reasonably possible after you have completed your entry and, in any event, at least 48 hours before the live draw takes place.</li>
            <li>For Instant Win Competitions, prizes are allocated at random to numbers in a spreadsheet. Each entry into the Instant Win Competition which correctly answers the Competition Question is then randomly allocated a number in that spreadsheet. If the number matches a prize, then the Entrant wins that prize.
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Entrants who pay for their entry online will be notified whether they have won (and, if they have won, what prize they have won) following submission of their entry.</li>
                    <li>Free entries into the Instant Win Competition will, so long as the entries are valid in accordance with these T&Cs, be randomly allocated a number on receipt by the Promoter. The Promoter will notify the Entrant if they are successful by an automated email sent to the contact email address that the Entrant provided with their entry. The email will be sent automatically as soon as the Entrant's number is identified as a prize winner. Unsuccessful Entrants via the free entry route will not be notified.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Those Entrants eligible to win a Prize as set out in 4.1 and 4.3 above shall be individually a "Winner" and collectively the "Winners".</li>
