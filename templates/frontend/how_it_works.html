    My Dream Car Africa runs its charity to support the Down syndrome and mentally handicapped community as part of its charity cause. This is borne out of our need and community allegiance where the mentally handicapped community serves as one of the most neglected groups in society. Proceeds from our competitions will go into supporting this community through the Down syndrome Society of Kenya and other mentally handicapped groups in Africa.
